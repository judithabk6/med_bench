# med_bench

**med_bench** is a Python package designed to wrap the most common estimators for causal mediation analysis in a single framework. We additionally allow for some flexibility in the choice of nuisance parameters models.

The simulations and performances evaluations realized here are presented in the following article

Judith Ab√©cassis, Julie Josse and Bertrand Thirion (2022). **Causal mediation analysis with one or multiple mediators: a comparative study.** [pdf](https://judithabk6.github.io/files/article_mediation_benchmark.pdf)

## Installation
med_bench can be installed by executing
```
python setup.py install
```

Or the package can be directly installed from the GitHub repository using
```
pip install git+git://github.com/judithabk6/med_bench.git
```

Installation time is a few minutes on a standard personal computer.


## Content
The `src` folder contains the main module with the implementation of the different estimators, the `script` folder contains the function used to simulate data and run the experiments, and the `results` folder contains all available results and code to reproduce the figures.
