The coefficient product method was proposed in

  exposure–mediator interactions and causal interpretation: Theoretical
  assumptions and implementation with SAS and SPSS macros`_.Psychological
  Methods, 18(2), 137–150. 2013.

**IPW estimator**


The Importance Weighting (IPW) method originally was introduced in 

and then presented in mediation analysis in

  probability weighting`_. Journal of Applied Econometrics, 29, issue 6, p.
  920-943, 2014.

**G-computation estimator**

The G-computation method for the mediation was introduced in

     J. Robins, `Double/debiased machine learning for treatment and structural
     parameters`, The Econometrics Journal, Volume 21, Issue 1, 2018.
