Coefficient Product

The coefficient product method was proposed in

  exposure–mediator interactions and causal interpretation: Theoretical
  assumptions and implementation with SAS and SPSS macros`_.Psychological
  Methods, 18(2), 137–150. 2013.

     Estimators for Mediation Analysis Under Sequential Conditional
     Independence`_. Journal of Business and Economic Statistics. 2015. 

IPW estimator
-------------

and then presented in mediation analysis in

  probability weighting`_. Journal of Applied Econometrics, 29, issue 6, p.
